## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with details of the changes you made. Stick to the format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
3. Update the `README.md` file if it is necessary. Keep in mind that most of the times  only excessive changes will require changes in this file.
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other leading developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
